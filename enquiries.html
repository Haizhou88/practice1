    <br>
    <p >Sensitive information will be used by us only:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>For a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose</li>
      <li>With your consent; or where required or authorised by law.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
     
    <h2>Third Parties</h2>
    <p>Where reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect your Personal Information only from you. However, in some circumstances we may be provided with information by third parties. In such a case we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of the information provided to us by the third party.</p>
